## Overview

This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of Indian movies sourced from IMDb to explore patterns in movie ratings and build predictive machine learning models. The main objectives are:

- Identify key attributes associated with higher audience ratings.
- Build predictive models to estimate IMDb ratings.
- Extract interpretable insights for filmmakers, critics, and audiences.

The project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple regression-based machine learning models. Ensemble models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were found to perform best.
