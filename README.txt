This folder contains helper scripts used in the process_notebook.

Files:
- data_prep.py: loads and cleans raw data.
- feature_engineering.py: builds actor/director experience features.
- modeling.py: builds preprocessing pipeline and trains XGBoost model.

These scripts assume relative paths from the project root.
